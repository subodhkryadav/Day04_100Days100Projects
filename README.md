## 🧠 Overview  
**Day 04** of my #100Days100Projects challenge — where logic meets intelligence!  
Today's goal: Make Python think for itself with **if-else**, **comparison operators**, **logical expressions**, and a **real-world number comparison tool**.

By mastering these tools, I’ve now taught Python how to make decisions like a mini brain! 🧠⚡

## 📚 Topics Covered

🔹 Writing conditional logic using `if`, `else`, and `elif`  
🔹 Using comparison operators: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`  
🔹 Chaining logic with `and`, `or`, `not`  
🔹 Nesting decisions for complex scenarios  
🔹 Creating interactive input-based decision-making tools

## 🎯 Today’s Project Spotlight: Number Comparison Tool 🔍

An intelligent Python script that compares two numbers and tells you:

📥 Which is greater or smaller  
📊 Whether both are equal  
🔗 How the logic flows using chained and nested conditions  

💡 Designed to simulate real-life decision-making logic and build strong foundational understanding of control structures in Python.
